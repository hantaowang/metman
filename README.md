A Node.JS server that runs a FORTRAN application and performs complex calculations that stimulate human body conditions inside a spacesuit on Mars.

Built for a research class at UC Berkeley that explored the k-suit, a flexible spacesuit design intended for human exploration on mars.
Originally intended for interal use because various teams needed to simulate these conditions but did not have the cs maturity required to build
and run the simulations.
